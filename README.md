# EIP 7702 demo

The project is designed to run in Docker, using VScode dev container. It should run
out of the box, but feel free to adapt it to your needs and make the necessary
modifications to get it to run with the installed Foundry, without Docker.

The subfolder webapp-demo-eip7702 is the web application that we ran outside
of Docker (directly on the system) with Node.js and npm. If preferred, it should
also run in Docker without any issues, the necessary software is installed.

## Foundry

**Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.**

Foundry consists of:

-   **Forge**: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
-   **Cast**: Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
-   **Anvil**: Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.
-   **Chisel**: Fast, utilitarian, and verbose solidity REPL.
